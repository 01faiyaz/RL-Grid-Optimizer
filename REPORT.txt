RL Grid Optimizer is designed to apply Reinforcement Learning to optimize a simulation of the California Electricity Grid duck curve; focusing on the
net load fluctuations due to renewable energy.

The goal of this project was to:
Flattern the net load curve
Improve renewable energy by using satellite intelligence
Optimize the battery operations

I use PYTHON, Stable-Baseline3 (PPO Agent), Gym Scaffold, and Parts of Generative AI for Debugging and Error handling.
This is all simulated under a grid performance environment with the GYM.

The final Environment is the GridEnvV2. It loads the profile, solar generation profilel, and the battery storage system. The actions go through -1 or 2 which discharge
the battery. 0 Does nothing. 1 indicates charging the battery.

The reward is to sustain reductions during the peak net load and proper battery usage.

Training Algorithm: Proximal Polixy Optimization [PPO]
It interacts with gridEnvV2, in which it will learn to minimize the net load peaks while respecting the constraints of the created battery
The model is then saved inside of ppo_grid_model_v2.zip inside model

Evaluation:
evalV2.py
    - Loads trained PPO agent
    - Runs the agent on the full simulation
    Tracks:
    - load_trace = original load
    - optimized_load = net load after RL control
    - battery_trace = battery SoC
    - reward_trace = reward per step
    Saves all traces to .npy files in evalOutputs/

analysEVAL.py
    - Loads evaluation outputs (.npy files)
    - Generates final plots (.png) for reporting:
        - Duck curve comparison (original vs RL optimized)
        - Battery SoC timeline
        - Net load timeline
        - Reward per step

Calculates Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
- Peak Reduction (%) = 29.45%
- Ramp Reduction (%) = -28.17%
- Renewable Utilization (%) = 36.09%
- Average Reward = -0.24
Saves KPI summary to evalOutputs/kpis_summary.csv

OBSERVATION:
Peak Reduction the peak load by 29% which is successful
Ramp reduction is -28% which indicates a maximum ramp increases
Renewable utilization of 36% shows moderate effectiveness of using solar energy
The average reward is positive
